     * 1. Return the nth Fibonacci number
     * Test Cases:
     * Input: 0     Output: 0
     * Input: 1    Output: 1
     * Input: 2     Output: 1
     * Input: 10    Output: 55

     * Input: [2,4,5,1,3,1]     Output: [1,1,2,3,4,5]
     * Input: [5,4,3,2,1]     Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

    *         - If an account has more than 10000 employees it is classified as large.
